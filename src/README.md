This is a vibe coding experiment. It involves using an AI agent to develop and give it instructions on what we want it to build, allowing the agent to code, access the terminal, execute corrective actions, among other things in order to build the app.

This example takes an Excel spreadsheet and, based on the values in one cell, generates the values for other cells, allowing the user to enrich the data using a web interface, to ultimately generate a new Excel file with the updated information.

The code was 100% generated by the agent; my role was to guide it through prompts in which I described the functionality I wanted and requested refactoring.

This took the agent, under my guidance, just a couple of hours to build the app. It's important to note that I hardly know how to program in Python (the programming language I chose) and that during the development, I didn't write a single line of code.
