This is a [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) experiment. It involves using a coding LLM / AI agent to develop an app by giving instructions about what we want it to build, allowing the agent to code, access the terminal, execute corrective actions, among other things, in order to build the app. In this project, I used the VS Code extension [GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode).

This simple example takes an Excel spreadsheet and, based on the values in one cell, generates values for other cells. It allows the user to enrich the data through a web interface, ultimately producing a new Excel file with the updated information.

The code was 100% generated by the agent. My role was to guide it through prompts where I described the functionality I wanted and requested refactoring.

It took the agent, under my guidance, just a couple of hours to build the app. It’s worth noting that I barely know how to program in Python (the programming language I chose) and that during development, I didn’t write a single line of code.
